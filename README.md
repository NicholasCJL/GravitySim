# GravitySim
Contains basic simulations of gravity with different numerical and simulation methods.
.NET 4 framework required.

How to use:

1. Enter a numerical value into the Vx, Vy, and mass fields. Click 'Change Parameters'.

2. Step 1 will make any new objects have the entered parameters and can be repeated multiple times. Click on the black space to add the object.

3. Select integration method and simulation method (Barnes-Hut method will be added in a later version).

4. Click 'Start Simulation' to start the simulation. Step 1 and 2 can still be executed while the simulation is running.

5. 'Reset Simulation' erases all objects and restarts the simulation.
